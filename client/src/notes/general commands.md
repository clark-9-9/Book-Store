You can use the EXISTS clause in PostgreSQL to achieve this. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM "amazon-books"
  WHERE _id = '672dbcccfdfba0f8c9fcbd8f'
) AS result;
```

This query will return `true` if the row exists in the table, and `false` if it doesn't.

If you want to return a boolean value directly, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT (_id = '672dbcccfdfba0f8c9fcbd8f')::boolean AS result
FROM "amazon-books"
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will return `true` if the row exists in the table, and `false` if it doesn't. The `::boolean` cast is used to convert the result to a boolean value.

You can also use the `FOUND` variable in PostgreSQL, which is set to `true` if the last SQL command affected at least one row, and `false` otherwise. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT FOUND AS result
FROM "amazon-books"
WHERE _id = '672dbcccfdfba0f8c9fcbd8f';
```

This query will return `true` if the row exists in the table, and `false` if it doesn't.
